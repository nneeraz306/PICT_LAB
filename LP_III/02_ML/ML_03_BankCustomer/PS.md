**Given a bank customer, build an neural network-based classifier that can determine whether they will leave or not in the next 6 months.**  

Dataset Description: The case study is from an open-source data set from Kaggle. The dataset contains 10,000 sample points with 14 distinct features such as Customer Id, Credit Score, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure,  Balance etc. 
Perform following steps: 
1. Read the dataset. 
2. Distinguish the feature and target set and divide the dataset into training and test sets. 
3. Normalize the train and test data. 
4. Initialize and build the model. Identify the points of improvement and implement the same. 
5. Print the accuracy score and confusion matrix (5points).
